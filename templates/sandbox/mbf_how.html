			<h1 class="fc-b fw-c fs-3">Some Frequent Asked Questions</h1>


			<br/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Can I implement myBusiness Facts into my own website?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">Facts provide important information about your business location, hours of operation , etc.  and the stories give context about your company mission and drive behind it. In other words, the facts give answer to your customer right brain (analytical), while the second are meant to appeal to your left side (creative emotional).</p>


			<hr/>

			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Can I decide not to include it on my website?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">Yes. that’s also an option. It depends on your business model, for example some travel companies prefer to have both strategies separated , in one hand their website and in the other Data and content for their resellers (Kayak, expedia, etc.) </p>

			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Are you creating an Artificial Intelligence system?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">No, we are creating tools that facilitate the communication between companies and A.I. Systems.</p>


			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Are you part of Siri, Watson, Cortana or other A.I. team?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">No, we are a neutral source of facts and content, and we are planning to remain like that.</p>


			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Do you resell MyRing information to third parties?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">Absolutely no, we are just a tool that our customers use to own and have full control over their data and facts. We do connect Apps interested in using our customers data, and we encourage a healthy market.  But the Data owner have the last say on everything.</p>


			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">How do you guys make money?</h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">By creating the best Capture, Organization and Data sharing tools for our customers, also by brokering Content and Data Distribution (CDN) with big consumers of Data and by creating dedicated reports to Research Institutions.</p>


			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Can you give me a warranty that Siri or watson will use my data?  </h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">No, no one can. A.I. operates in a similar way to Search Engines, it uses an internal logic (aka “The algorithm”) that defines what to use and what to discard. The only thing anyone can do is to play by their rules and optimize everything so they find their data relevant for their results and A.I. answers. </p>


			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">Why this is important?  </h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">1. Because your traditional Website + SEO strategy is not enough.

Websites, paid banners and SEO techniques, belong to the desktop environment. Currently there are more mobile users than desktop users and this will only increase the next 10 years.</p>

				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">2. Because a responsive HTML website doesn't make you mobile friendly: Mobile users only spend 14% in their Mobile Device Browsers, even the best responsive website ever designed will miss 86% of the user available attention in any mobile device and 100% on any Weareable.  </p>




			<hr/>
			<h3 class="fw-c fc-g lh-1">In one line, what you guys do?  </h3>
				
				<p class="fs-1 lh-1-2">We set your company for success in a present where A.I. , mobile and weareables are taking over. </p>
