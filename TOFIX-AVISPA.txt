#FIXED  When interface links to
https://avispa.openring.com/blacklabelrobot
it redirects to an unsafe
http://avispa.openring.com/blacklabelrobot/_home
and it shows UNABLE TO CONNECT

Solution: Make redirect to https explicit


In the Ringmodeler
"None" string appears by default in all fields. Remove it or make it go
when somebody clicks on it

In the Ringmodeler
Create a better way to link rings. 
You should be able to write the name of the ring and fields of interest
Also a ring finder for me not to have to obtain the API url from another window and have to copy and paste it. Have it be automatically validated 


Estos son los problemillas que encontre:
-#FIXED Cuando quieres salvar un item en cualquier Rings te manda un ‘Internal Server Error’
-Ring modeler no te permite guardar cambios al esquema (Unable to connect)
-Ring modeler no puede crear nuevos Rings 
-#FIXED El Photo widget no puede subir fotos
